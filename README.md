# Farrakatonia-SP
The project is inspired in KSP and I just want to try tro recreate some machanics (or at least this at the moment) and create a tiny simple space program

## Formatting
* The project will be done in c++ (or at least now. I'm using g++ but if it works like the same with another compiler you can use the one you prefer the most).
* Tabs equivalent to 4 spaces.
* To ask for input and output use only `iostream` library.
* Write just the least inside `main()` to keep the code tidy.
* To create variables and functions choose names that describes well the perform of it and use **camelCase**.
* Do not use generic names like *x* or *y* on global variables. You should instead use them inside functions like `movement()`.
* Do not put space around parentheses: `if(condition){`.
* If there are no bugs and conflicts you can use `namespace std` and similars.
* All project header's functons must use namespace `fkphy`.

## Where to focus on
At the moment I will be start focusing in simple physics such as kinematics or dynamics.
